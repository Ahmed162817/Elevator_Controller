## Introduction
- Elevator controllers are essential digital systems designed to manage the safe and efficient movement
of elevators within buildings. They handle user requests, control the elevator cabinâ€™s motion, and
ensure reliable operation under various conditions.

- This project focuses on designing, implementing, and verifying a N-floor (Parameterized) elevator
controller. The design emphasizes request prioritization, stop/resume functionality, and timing
accuracy. Simulation and verification are used to confirm correct behavior under multiple operating
scenarios.
